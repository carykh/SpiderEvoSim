NOTE: This project, like all my projects, are not meant to be consumer products with perfect QA. Rather, it's just me, as one person, coding a casual experiment to the point that it works well enough on my computer to make a video from it! No more, no less. (I used to not put my code online, just like when you create a Minecraft world with your friends, you don't have to share the world with everyone. I just started posting code here because I wanted to make it easier for eager devs to make mods.) Long story short, I won't be doing bug-fixing or tech support on this project.
